<p> I have a call from the walfare officers of some lodge to collect the declaration form and gave it to them which I have already collected.
<p> Father came by morning and I have to go to ATM and also to cut my hair and shape my beard. 
<p> When I sat to cut my hair I got a call from ebin that new new members are waiting at the lodge.
<p> then I was around 3km away. on the way my mobile phone fell down I thought it might be dead , but nothing except some scratch.
<p> there was one relive today. 
<p> someone knocked at the room and there was two new members , I gave them two rooms that we already arranged.
<p> total of 4 newcomers today.
<p> by night distributed toothpaste , brush , washing and bathing soaps and essentials.
<p> It was informed that government is now uses paid quarentine other than those who caned earlier.
<p> handed the jackfruit plant and banana seed which I have brought from Agriculture office to father.
