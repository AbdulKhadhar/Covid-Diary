<h2> Clarifying the Works </h2>
<i>Wed 27_05_2020 </i>
<p> It was too hot in the room yesterday even night was raining 
<p> Today I wake up at 6.30am and got the food to distribute.
<p> The scooter which we planned for distribution of food got a starting trouble then cleared.
<p> We have duty in five centres including ours.
<p> Not mentioning the names I was very interested to meet new people
<p> We always wear masks and glosses while contacting them.
<p> Helth department officials  visited today for checking the temperature .
<p> Haved a nap after lunch.
<p> Got the food by 8.00pm and distribued . 
<p> Remembered police about the other centres for patrolling.
<p> Back to our saty lodge 
<p> Clarified something about the lodge names and was a nice day.
