<h2> Negetive sometimes give a smile </h2>
<i> 08_06_2020 Mon </i>
<p> today was the last day permitted by parents for staying here at quarentine center.
<p> I have already informed them that I will be back there after getting the covid test result.
<p> after distribution of breakfast with Anandhu he went back to his lodge later he called me.
<p> He said that his and my test results are NEGETIVE more than that all results of IQ under us were negetive.
<p> I was happy but not at a high level because it's not over.
<p> There was one relive today and her result was also negative
<p> Anandhu got a call at evening that his cource certificate is available at the institution at Kochi .
<p> he will go to kochi tomorrow morning . we saw him at a saloon at evening.
<p> There is a new member in quarentine by 11.00pm . he said  have no food but we were helpless because the hotels were closed
<p> We give him a bottle of water and said good night.
<p> Another day with a positivity by Negetive
