<i> 05_06_2020 Fri </i>
<p> Today after distributing the breakfast I have go to the lodge with Anandhu where he is staying and his actual duty is there.
<p> the main reason is the swab collection keosk is nearby.
<p> We realised the importance of the day 'World Environmental day' . the floor of the lodge were tiled
<p> We found a bucket filled with soil and plated something that we got. within the walls that was only possible.
<p> It was informed that an ambulance is ready for picking two of the quarentined people for swab collection . ours is also collecting today.
<p> Welfare Officer from another lodge gave me the form of declaration to reliving people for giving them to lodge under him.
<p> At the hospital we have talked to a couple who were also there for collecting swab.
<p> When called my name I entered to a room where there was two wearing PPE kits . 
<p> collected Nasopharyngeal swab and Throat swab.
<p> Throat swab collection was little bit fearful but both collection is with a less time and no pain or a  less pain.
<p> After that we were back on action . Packed lunch and distributed.
<p> there was two relieves today , they were already completed the period of institutional Quarentine and they were waiting for COVID test result.
<p> fortunately both were negetive. and they go to home quarentine
<p> one of the lodge had a water problem later fixed.
<p> From now waiting for the result of swab and got a good day.
