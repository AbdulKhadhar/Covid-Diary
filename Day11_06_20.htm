<h2> Be patient </h2>
<i> 12_06_2020 Thu </i>
<p> after distributing breakfast I was tend to take a bath.
<p> then was I hearing that loud noise by the lodge owner he was quarrelling with the cleaning staff who was assigned by the Local self government for taking food waste and keeping the space clean.
<p> the problem was that some day before he asked her to take the waste cloth on the corner of his lodge likely bedsheets.
<p> She then asked with a tone of receiving some profit for that . and he reply at that moment with full confidence that he will give her some cash for that.
<p> on the coming day he take that waste cloth and burned at his home . I was promised him earlier that I will manage the case and he don't mind it.
<p> He was very angrier to her without giving her any respect. that's the time I thought of the message passing before a call rings tht to corporate with cleaning staffs ,doctors , police etc.
<p> Every day the waste were down by the cat or dog . we have said to him meny time , he also made a problem that it was because of her.
<p> When I was bathing the problem outside was not at the end he again came down then some balh blah talks and said he was actually making a problem.
<p> We know his problem that the lodge rooms (only a few) were not able to be used by others . but man must be some kind and less greedy.
<p> he said his wife I think a. heart patient , I don't know why then he burnt the cloth at his home. I was giving him a lot of respect until today because aI realised his true character.
<p> One of the qurentained was taking vedio of the incidents and asking something which have a hidden mind , he asked that the waste bins were not down till then , fortunately a cat at that time jumped t one of the waste bins.
<p> I said him to catch that also. 
<p> There was a newcomer in one of the lodge we have distributed the food and go to collect mineral what because the stock was done.
<p> we stored 40 cases with twelve bottle each.
<p> there was a continuous call that there was a new member in one of the lodge, we have checked there was no one
<p> one of the new comer said he want cough syrup , I doubted the need to ebin we told the HI about his helth. he said there will be a visit by doctor tomorrow.
<p> at night there was a new member at the lodge where we already checked . his visit was also not informed to us.
<p> today was a Little bit stressful day but it was like a lesson to me .
<p> there was one relive today
