<p> Wake up by 7.00 and done the distribution of breakfast
<p> Distributed the lunch for all lodges . 
<p> talked a bit with the quarentine people with safe distance.
<p> One said that the food providing was not enough but it's clearly enough for a normal diet.
<p> He called the welfare officer and informed it . Nothing to do with us , we helped him by giving a part of food but I don't know why he had complained. 
<p> Still he was on our side . 
<p> It was raining , we give the dinner a bit later due to the rain
<p> One of them said that no one is coming their clean his room . But we can't provide him somdone 
<p> Returned with the promise of bringing him a broom tomorrow .
<p> was a good day . realised how people is being irritated in the four walls
<p> hoping more whatsapp status and openions about the institutional quarentine.
