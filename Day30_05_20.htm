<h2> Freedom by Restrictions </h2>
<i> 30_05_2020 Sat </h2>
<p> After Distributing the breakfast we came back to our lodge.
<p> lunch was distributed by the government staff volunteer and one other on the other lodges.
<p> One of the quarentined were a cancer patient ,when we brought him tea in evening we got a pleasant smile and a great Thanks.
<p> As anyone know locked in room with door and window closed will be similar to jail conditions.
<p> therefore they open the door sometimes , I don't support much but keeping a safe distance with a zero chance of spread , sometimes I also believed in freedom
<p> well Quarantine is restricted for freedom and we must have admire it but it was surprised about the lodge owner sayings that may be the virus may spred to houses within a range of greater than 10m range . I don't know what made him think like that.
<p> It was a nice day with some realisations 
<p> Usual call from my mother made a feeling of missing her and father 
<p> passed an another day
