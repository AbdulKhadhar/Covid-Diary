<i> 10_06_2020 Wed </i> 
<p> like yesterday there was two knocking on my door without any instructions .
<p> I was confused and then confirmed . Opened two rooms for them
<p> there was a relive after Lunch.
<p> most of there were happy to leave the Institutional Quarentine.
<p> but those who we have interacted the fourteen days with us when they say thanks will actually make a missing.
