<h2> Birthday Celebration </h2>
<i> 12_06_2020 Fri </i> 
<p> After distribution of breakfast we called Anandhu for being with us after lunch because today is his birthday.
<p> He leaved the duty day before but he was there for us along lunch.
<p> we have ordered a cake at one of the Baker shop. 
<p> It was not at a celebration mode on this COVID time.but it will be a little relief from the works .
<p> we also called a previous volunteer Nithin .
<p> today Nithin and Anandhu distributed food over one region an other by me and Ebin.
<p> after that we collected the cake and Anandhu cut it.
<p> I asked them to give a pice to the qurentaine people.
<p> They were happy to give , so we distributed to a few.
<p> After giving them a piece of cake with a maintain of social distance they gave wishes for Anandhu.
<p> We got a lot to talk at this night.
<p> I realised that this is the last night of my stay in qurentaine duty.
